### List of Features

You can see more details of features from this wiki: [features](https://rsdoctor.dev/guide/start/features).

## Quick Start

In a Rspack-based project, you can enable Rsdoctor as follows:

1. Install the Rsdoctor plugin:

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rsdoctor/rspack-plugin -D" />

2. Add `RSDOCTOR=true` env variable before the CLI command:

```bash
# dev
RSDOCTOR=true rspack serve

# build
RSDOCTOR=true rspack build
```

After running the above commands, Rspack will automatically register the Rsdoctor plugin, and after the build is completed, it will open the build analysis page. For complete features, please refer to [Rsdoctor document](https://rsdoctor.dev/).

## Options

:::

If you need to configure the [options](https://rsdoctor.dev/config/options/options) provided by the Rsdoctor plugin, please manually register the Rsdoctor plugin:

```ts title="rspack.config.ts"
import { RsdoctorRspackPlugin } from '@rsdoctor/rspack-plugin';

export default {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // Only register the plugin when RSDOCTOR is true, as the plugin will increase the build time.
    process.env.RSDOCTOR &&
      new RsdoctorRspackPlugin({
        // plugin options
      }),
  ].filter(Boolean),
};
```
