# Bundle analysis

Rspack's Command Line Interface (CLI) supports bundle analysis out-of-box via the `--analyze` option. It uses [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer) behind the scenes.

```sh
$ rspack build --analyze
```

You can also generate a `stats.json` file for further analysis with other bundle analysis tools like [bundle-stats](https://github.com/relative-ci/bundle-stats) or [statoscope](https://statoscope.tech/):

```sh
$ rspack build --json stats.json
```

## Use Rsdoctor

**Rsdoctor** provides the `Bundle Size` module, which is mainly used to analyze the information of the build artifacts of **Webpack** or **Rspack**, including the **size of resources**, **duplicate packages**, and **module reference relationships**:

- **Bundle Overview**: Displays the total number and size of artifacts, as well as the number and size of each file type. It also shows the duplicate packages and their reference chains.
- **Bundle Analysis Module**: Analyzes the size and code information of the build artifacts' resources (**Assets**) and the included **Modules**. In this module, you can view the **actual code size of modules after packaging** in the Assets, as well as the original code or **packaged code segments** and **module reference relationships**.

Click on the **"Bundle Size"** option in the navigation bar to view the Bundle analysis report. You can see more details from this page: [Bundle Size](https://rsdoctor.dev/zh/guide/usage/bundle-size)

### Reduce duplicate dependencies

Bundle size optimization is an important part in production build because it directly affects the user experience of online users. In this document, we will introduce some common bundle size optimization methods in Rspack.

It is common for web projects to bundle multiple versions of third-party dependencies. Duplicate dependencies can lead to increased bundle size and slower build speed.

- Detect duplicate dependencies

You can use [Rsdoctor](https://rsdoctor.dev) to detect whether there are duplicate dependencies in the project. Rsdoctor will analyze during the build process, find any duplicate bundled dependencies and display them visually:
